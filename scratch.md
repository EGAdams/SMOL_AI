You are an AI developer who is trying to write a program that will generate code for the user based on their intent.\n\n            In response to the user's prompt:\n\n            ---\n            the purpose of our app is: {prompt}\n            ---\n\n            the files we have decided to generate are: {filepaths_string}\n\n            Now that we have a list of files, we need to understand what dependencies they share.\n            Please name and briefly describe what is shared between the files we are generating, including exported variables, data schemas, id names of every DOM elements that javascript functions will use, message names, and function names.\n            Exclusively focus on the names of the shared dependencies, and do not add any other explanation.\n            ", '# MODE_1_FUNCTIONS.cpp\n\nThis file contains the implementation of the `Mode1Functions` class. The class has a constructor that takes in several objects as parameters, including `Player`, `PinInterface`, `GameState`, and `History`. It initializes member variables `_player1`, `_player2`, `_gameState`, `_history`, `_undo`, `_pointLeds`, `_mode1Score`, and `_serveLeds` with the corresponding parameters.\n\nThe destructor is empty and does not perform any specific actions.\n\n## mode1ButtonFunction()\n\nThis function is responsible for handling button presses in mode 1. It uses a switch statement to determine the action based on the value of `_gameState->getPlayerButton()`. \n\n- Case 0: No action is taken.\n- Case 1: Player 1 scores a point. It sets the mode 1 undo, checks if point flashing is enabled, updates the player points, delays the game, updates the undo memory, and calls the `playerOneScore()` function of `_mode1Score`.\n- Case 2: Undo button is pressed. It delays the game and calls the `mode1Undo()` function of `_undo`.\n- Case 3: Player 2 scores a point. It sets the mode 1 undo, checks if point flashing is enabled, updates the player points, delays the game, updates the undo memory, and calls the `playerTwoScore()` function of `_mode1Score`.\n- Case 4: Undo button is pressed. It delays the game and calls the `mode1Undo()` function of `_undo`.\n\nAfter performing the corresponding action, it sets `_gameState->setPlayerButton(0)` to reset the button state.\n\n## mode1ServeFunction()\n\nThis function is responsible for handling the serve action in mode 1. It sets the mode 1 undo and calls the `serveSwitch()` function of `_serveLeds`.\n\n## pointFlash()\n\nThis function is responsible for handling the point flashing feature in mode 1. If point flashing is enabled, it checks the points of both players. If a player has more than 3 points, it performs the following actions:\n\n- For player 1: If running on Windows, it sets the points to 99 and updates the point LEDs. Otherwise, it checks the time difference between the current time and the previous time. If the difference is greater than the flash delay, it toggles the 4th LED on and off by setting the points to the stored value or 99, respectively. It updates the point LEDs and updates the previous time.\n- For player 2: Same logic as player 1.\n\n# MODE_1_FUNCTIONS.h\n\nThis header file defines the `Mode1Functions` class. It includes several other header files, such as "Arduino.h", "GameState.h", "GameTimer.h", "MODE_1_SCORE.h", "POINT_LEDs.h", "PinInterface.h", and "UNDO.h". It also forward declares the `History` class.\n\nThe `Mode1Functions` class has a public constructor that takes in `Player`, `PinInterface`, `GameState`, and `History` objects as parameters. It also has a public destructor.\n\nThe public member functions include:\n- `mode1ButtonFunction()`: Handles button presses in mode 1.\n- `mode1ServeFunction()`: Handles the serve action in mode 1.\n- `pointFlash()`: Handles the point flashing feature in mode 1.\n\nThe private member variables include:\n- `_player1`: Pointer to the `Player` object for player 1.\n- `_player2`: Pointer to the `Player` object for player 2.\n- `_gameState`: Pointer to the `GameState` object.\n- `_history`: Pointer to the `History` object.\n- `_undo`: An instance of the `Undo` class.\n- `_pointLeds`: An instance of the `PointLeds` class.\n- `_mode1Score`: An instance of the `Mode1Score` class.\n- `_serveLeds`: An instance of the `ServeLeds` class.\n\nNote: The specific implementation of the `Player`, `PinInterface`, `GameState`, `History`, `Undo`, `PointLeds`, `Mode1Score`, and `ServeLeds` classes are not provided in the given files.', "['MODE_1_FUNCTIONS.cpp', 'MODE_1_FUNCTIONS.h']
