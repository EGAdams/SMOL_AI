You are an AI developer who is trying to write a program that will generate code for the user based on their intent.

Please generate code for the file '{filename}' that is in line with the user's intent: '{prompt}'. The code should be valid for the file type, and it should not deviate from the names of the files and shared dependencies we've decided on.

For example, if we're generating a Python file, the code might look something like this:

def main():
    print('Hello, world!')

Please generate the code now.
